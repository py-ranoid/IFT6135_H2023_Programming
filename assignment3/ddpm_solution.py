# # Diffusion Basics
# 
# Diffusion models are a new and recent class of generative models that rely on a forward diffusion process and a backward denoising process. The forward diffusion process adds a little bit of noise at each step, thus making the input image progressively noisier. On the other hand, the aim of the backward process is to denoise at each step, and is supposed to reverse the effect of the forward process. In this setup, only the backward process is parameterized by a learnable model while the forward process converges to something known, like $\mathcal{N}(0, I)$. If the learning is done correctly and the backward process works well enough, it would ideally be able to progressively remove noise from complete noise and lead to a sample from the data distribution.
# 
# Now, lets try to formalize this. Suppose our data samples come from the distribution $q(x_0)$. The forward distribution can be parameterized as 
# 
# \begin{align*}
# q(x_t | x_{t-1}) = \mathcal{N}(\sqrt{1-\beta_t} x_{t-1}, \beta_t I)
# \end{align*}
# 
# where if we consider a finite number of timesteps T, then
# 
# \begin{align*}
# q(x_{1:T} | x_0) = \prod_{t=1}^T q(x_t | x_{t-1})
# \end{align*}
# 
# where $\beta_t$ are the hyperparameters that govern how quickly structure is destroyed in the forward process. One can see this as progressively adding more noise to the input data. One benefit of considering a gaussian distribution above is that it leads to a very nice property that the distribution $q(x_t | x_0)$ becomes known and tractable, so one is able to directly generate a sample from any point in the forward trajectory. In particular, with a bit of algebra, one can obtain
# 
# \begin{align*}
# q(x_t | x_0) = \mathcal{N}(\sqrt{\bar{\alpha}_t} x_0, (1 - \bar{\alpha}_t) I)
# \end{align*}
# 
# where $\bar{\alpha}_t = \prod_{i=1}^t \alpha_t$ and $\alpha_t = 1 - \beta_t$. And ideally we want to set $\beta_t$'s such that $q(x_T | x_0) \approx \mathcal{N}(0, I)$.
# 
# So far, we have obtained the forward structure-destroying diffusion process as well as how to sample directly from any point in the forward process conditioned on the initial conditions. Now, we want to learn a reverse process that takes us back from a noisy sample to something that has less noise. We do this by parameterizing this distribution with a Neural Network like
# 
# \begin{align*}
#   p_\theta(x_{0:T}) = p(x_T) \prod_{t=1}^T p_\theta(x_{t-1} | x_t)
# \end{align*}
# 
# where we consider $p(x_T)$ as just $\mathcal{N}(0, I)$ since at the end of the forward diffusion we are approximating that. Further, we also assume that each conditional above is parameterized as a gaussian distribution, that is
# 
# \begin{align*}
#   p_\theta(x_{t-1} | x_t) = \mathcal{N}(\mu_\theta(x_t, t), \tilde{\beta}_t)
# \end{align*}
# 
# where $\tilde{\beta}_t = \frac{1 - \bar{\alpha}_{t-1}}{1 - \bar{\alpha}_t} \beta_t$ which is because after doing some algebra, we can find that
# 
# \begin{align*}
#   q(x_{t-1} | x_t, x_0) = \mathcal{N}(\tilde{\mu}_t, \tilde{\beta}_t)
# \end{align*}
# 
# where $\tilde{\mu}_t = \frac{\sqrt{\alpha_t} ( 1 - \bar{\alpha}_{t-1})}{1 - \bar{\alpha}_t}x_t + \frac{\sqrt{\bar{\alpha}_{t-1}}\beta_t}{1 - \bar{\alpha}_t}x_0$. 
# 
# This particular parameterization of $q(x_{t-1} | x_t, x_0)$ follows through by considering the Bayes rule combined with some algebra. Since the backward learned process is aimed to approximate the true backward process $q(x_{t-1} | x_t, x_0)$, it boils down to matching the means $\tilde{\mu}_t$ with $\mu_\theta(x_t)$ as the variances are kept the same by design. A little more algebraic manipulation and reparameterization tricks lead us to
# 
# \begin{align*}
#   \tilde{\mu}_t = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\alpha_t}} \left(x_t - \frac{1 - \alpha_t}{\sqrt{1 - \bar{\alpha}_t}} \epsilon_t\right)
# \end{align*}
# 
# To match this, we need $\mu_\theta(x_t, t) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\alpha_t}} \left(x_t - \frac{1 - \alpha_t}{\sqrt{1 - \bar{\alpha}_t}} \epsilon_t\right)
# $
# 
# Given this formulation for $\mu_\theta$, we can use reparameterization to get $x_{t-1}$ from $x_t$ as
# 
# \begin{align*}
#   x_{t-1} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\alpha_t}} \left(x_t - \frac{1 - \alpha_t}{\sqrt{1 - \bar{\alpha}_t}} \epsilon_t\right) + \tilde{\beta}_t \epsilon
# \end{align*}
# 
# Thus, instead of parameterizing $\mu_\theta$ using a Neural Network, one can parameterize $\epsilon_t$ using the network so that we can do the backward diffusion as
# 
# \begin{align*}
#   x_{t-1} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\alpha_t}} \left(x_t - \frac{1 - \alpha_t}{\sqrt{1 - \bar{\alpha}_t}} \epsilon_\theta(x_t, t)\right) + \tilde{\beta}_t \epsilon
# \end{align*}
# 
# In short, thus, we get a forward diffusion process parameterized as $q(x_t | x_{t-1} = \mathcal{N}(\sqrt{1 - \beta_t} x_{t-1}, \beta_t I)$ where one can sample $q(x_t | x_0)$ in one-shot in closed form without having to go through $t = 1, ..., t-1$. On the other hand, the backward process parameterizes the noise at time-step $t$, that is $\epsilon_\theta(x_t, t)$ which can be used to run the backward process as $p(x_{t-1} | x_t) = \mathcal{N}(\frac{1}{\sqrt{\alpha}_t} \left(x_t - \frac{1 - \alpha_t}{\sqrt{1 - \bar{\alpha}_t} }\epsilon_\theta(x_t, t)\right), \tilde{\beta}_t I)$.
# 
# And learning of this model leads to a simple objective function, which can be defined as 
# \begin{align*}
# \mathbb{E}_{t\sim \mathcal{U}(1,T), x_0, \epsilon_t} \left[|| \epsilon_t - \epsilon_\theta(\sqrt{\bar{\alpha}_t} x_0 + \sqrt{1 - \bar{\alpha}_t} \epsilon_t, t) ||^2\right]
# \end{align*}
# 
# For our settings, instead of the $L_2$ loss, we will use the huber loss, which is $L_1$ loss but near the origin, acts as an $L_2$ loss.

# # Forward Diffusion Process
# 
# To define the forward diffusion, we need to model the distribution $q(x_t | x_0)$ in a manner that does not go through $t = 1, ..., t-1$. In particular, as defined at the start, we can obtain the distribution as
# 
# \begin{align*}
#   q(x_t | x_0) = \mathcal{N}(\sqrt{\bar{\alpha}_t} x_0, (1 - \bar{\alpha}_t) I)
# \end{align*}
# 
# Since you have already computed the required coefficients above, your task is to now complete the function q_sample which takes $(x_0, t)$ as input and returns a sample from $q(x_t | x_0)$ in a batched manner, that is, in parallel for a batch of $x_0$'s and a batch of different timesteps $t$. You can use the extract function provided to get the coefficients at the right timesteps.

# # Backward Learned Diffusion Process
# 
# Now suppose you have access to the model $\epsilon_\theta$ in the above description of diffusion models. We know that given a noisy sample $x_t$, one can obtain a slightly denoised version of this sample through the distribution $p_\theta(x_{t-1} | x_t)$, which in our setup is now defined as
# 
# \begin{align*}
# p_\theta(x_{t-1} | x_t) = \mathcal{N}(\frac{1}{\sqrt{\alpha_t}}\left(x_t - \frac{1 - \alpha_t}{\sqrt{1 - \bar{\alpha}_t}}\epsilon_\theta(x_t, t)\right), \tilde{\beta}_t I)
# \end{align*}
# 
# Below, the task is to complete the function p_sample that takes as input the denoising model $\epsilon_\theta$, a batched noisy image $x$, a batched time-step $t$ and a scalar $t\_index$, and it has to return a sample from $p(x_{t-1} | x_t)$. In the case that $t=1$ (or in code, $t=0$), please just return the mode instead of a sample. For doing this if-condition, you can use $t\_index$ which is just a scalar instead of its batched variant $t$.
# 
# Note that all the coefficients $\bar{\alpha}_t$, etc. are already computed above for all $t$, so use the extract function provided to obtain them at different corresponding timesteps.

# # Define the Loss
# 
# Now that we have both the forward and the backward diffusion process ready, we need a training criterion. In the introduction, we already saw that the optimization objective for training is to minimize:
# 
# \begin{align*}
# \mathbb{E}_{t\sim \mathcal{U}(1,T), x_0, \epsilon_t} \left[|| \epsilon_t - \epsilon_\theta(\sqrt{\bar{\alpha}_t} x_0 + \sqrt{1 - \bar{\alpha}_t} \epsilon_t, t) ||^2\right]
# \end{align*}
# 
# This boils down to
# 
# - Generating some gaussian noise from $\mathcal{N}(0, I)$.
# - Getting the noisy images at time $t$ in a batched, one-shot fashion.
# - Getting the estimate of noise from the noisy images.
# - Computing the loss between the estimate of noise and the actual noise.
# 
# In practice here, we will use the **huber** loss instead of the squared loss; so please implement that. Feel free to use PyTorch's criterion to get the huber loss formulation.
